# Repligit

This app's only purpose is to replicate(fork) it's github repo to the user's GitHub profile

## Run
To run it you should have *python2.7* and *flask* installed on your host machine
And register it as OAUTH app in GitHub. 
It means that GitHub provides you with *"client_id"* and *"secret_id"*.
And you should provide GitHub with Repligit's callback path
Then go repo's root and run in your shell the following:

* export FLASK_APP="repligit.py"
* export SECRET= *your secret_id*
* export CLIENT_ID= *your client_id*
* flask run --host="0.0.0.0"

The Repligit's workflow is:

* user goes to Repligit's url (e.g. "0.0.0.0:5000/" (first view) )
* user clicks the "Fork" button
* user is redirected to GitHub to authorize
* user is redirected back to Repligit's *'callback'* page by GitHub with a temporary code in a code parameter(2nd view)
* Repligit exchanges this code for an access token with GitHub
* Repligit forks the repo via GitHub API asyncroniously

Then user may check GitHub whether the request is complete
